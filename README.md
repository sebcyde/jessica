# Welcome to Jessica!

This mobile web app is built to serve three main functions. It has use as a calendar/ event tracker, as well as a notepad and To-Do list.

Upon opening you will be prompted to create a user account in order to save all of your events/notes/to-dos to your unique Firebase account. This also provides a layer of user safety as it prevents users from seeing other users information.

App is still being maintained/updated as of 13/10/22.

Tech Used: React, TypeScript, SASS, Firebase
Built by Sebastian Cyde (pronounced 'side') 2022.
